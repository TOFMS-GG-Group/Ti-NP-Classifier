Steps
1. Install streamlit, pycharm (or any other IED). Streamlit opens in a browser (for example: google chrome) and the browser acts as graphical user interface.
   IED can be used to read or edit codes.
2. Using Pycharm terminal open streamlit webApp on browser by typing "streamlit run webapp.py" and press enter. Here webapp is the name of the file that contains source codes.
3. Both source code file and helper file should be kept in the same folder.
4. Import all the libraries needed and install the packages.
5. Once you have running webapp, drag or upload the files that you want to classify.
6. A csv or an excel file where mass is defined in attograms can be used for the current program or it can be changed by the user if needed.
7. The user can set the XD_mass (detection limit mass) to classify the particles.
